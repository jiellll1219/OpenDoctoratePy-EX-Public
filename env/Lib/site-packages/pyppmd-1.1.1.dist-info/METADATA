Introduction
------------

``pyppmd`` module provides classes and functions for compressing and decompressing text data,
using PPM(Prediction by partial matching) compression algorithm which has several variations of implementations.
PPMd is the implementation by Dmitry Shkarin.
PyPPMD use Igor Pavlov's range coder introduced in 7-zip.

The API is similar to Python's bz2/lzma/zlib module.

Some parts of th codes are derived from ``7-zip``, ``pyzstd`` and ``ppmd-cffi``.


Development status
------------------

A project status is considered as ``Stable``.

Extra input byte
----------------

``PPMd`` algorithm and implementation is designed to use ``Extra`` input byte.
The encoder will omit a last null (b"\0") byte when last byte is b"\0".
You may need to provide an extra null byte when you don't get expected size of
extracted data.

You can do like as:

.. code-block::

    dec = pyppmd.Ppmd7Decoder(max_order=6, mem_size=16 << 10)
    result = dec.decode(compressed, length)
    if len(result) < length:
        if dec.needs_input:
            # ppmd need an extra null byte
            result += dec.decode(b"\0", length - len(result))
        else:
            result += dec.decode(b"", length - len(result))


.. warning::
   When use it on MSYS2/MINGW64 environment, you should set environment variable ``SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=stdlib``
